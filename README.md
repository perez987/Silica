# Silica

A lightweight code editor for macOS, made of glass. Open a folder, find files fast,
and edit with syntax highlighting, a minimap and a Markdown preview, all in a native
SwiftUI and AppKit app.

## Download

Get the latest DMG from [Releases](https://github.com/dqhieu/Silica/releases/latest),
open it and drag Silica to Applications. Silica checks for updates once a day and
installs them for you; you can turn that off in Settings › General.

Silica needs macOS 26 or later.

## Features

- **Projects.** Open a folder to get a window with a file tree. Files and folders
  your `.gitignore` excludes are dimmed, and the tree updates as files change on disk.
  Create, rename and move files to the Trash right in the tree, and filter it as you type.
- **Quick Open and project search.** Jump to any file with fuzzy matching, or search
  the text of every file in the project.
- **Syntax highlighting** for 25 languages, including Swift, JavaScript, TypeScript,
  Python, Go, Rust, C, C++, Java, Kotlin, HTML, CSS, JSON, YAML and Markdown.
- **Nine color themes**, each with a light and a dark palette: Atom One, GitHub,
  Xcode, Solarized, Catppuccin, Gruvbox, Tokyo Night, Rosé Pine and Dracula.
- **Markdown preview**, with highlighted code blocks.
- **Editing tools.** Tabs, line numbers, indent guides, a minimap, word wrap, go to
  line, toggle comment, and moving or duplicating lines.
- **Picks up where you left off.** Projects reopen their tabs, and recent projects
  are on the welcome window. You can turn off the welcome window at launch in
  Settings › General and reopen it with File › Welcome Window or ⇧⌘1.
- **Appearance and language.** Choose glass or opaque windows in Settings › General.
  The opaque editor background is black in dark appearance and white in light appearance.
  Silica follows the macOS language preference, with English and Spanish available.
- **Works with Finder.** Use Open With, drop files on the Dock icon, or run
  `open -a Silica <path>`.
